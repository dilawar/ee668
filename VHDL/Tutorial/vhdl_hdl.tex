\begin{abstract}
  
  It has been assumed that you have been using at least C/C++. 
  
  To do VHDL related assignments, you need not know full VHDL.  Only what
  minimal is required discussed here. You need to know entity-architecture pair,
  data-types, and use of components in VHDL. Mimicking Dodo the bird of
  \emph{Alice in Wonderland} one can say that the best way to learn a language
  is to write few programs in it. 

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
  
 Let's begin with a toy shown in following figure. One exercise is immediate :
 \emph{Write its equivalent proto-RTL description}. Later, we can simply
 translate this proto-RTL description to VHDL (or any other HDL) by hand, or
 better, we can write a computer program to automate the conversion.
 \footnote{Dr. Sameer Sahashrabudhdhe work (guide Prof. Madav Desai) AHIR
 tool-chain does something similar. It converts a C-program to VHDL.}

 In this document, we'll describe this circuit directly in VHDL.

    \caption{A small logic circuit. This represents one of the most commonly
    found hardware block : some combinational logic attached to the input of
    flip-flop.  We have D-type flip-flop on the right. Unused pins are
    \texttt{S} (set), $\bar{Q}$, and \texttt{CE} (clock-enable).}

\paragraph{Abstraction available in VHDL}

  VHDL provides a block-level abstraction of system. One needs to know the input
  and output (hereafter, \textbf{port}) of the system. We have \texttt{a},
  \texttt{b}, \texttt{clk}, and \texttt{reset} as input (port), and \texttt{out}
  as the output (port) of system shown in figure \ref{fig:circuit}. Immediately
  after setting the ports, we ask what sort of data these ports carries : the
  \textbf{type} of ports.  We assume that all ports in this system have
  data-type \textbf{bit}. It is usually not the case. We can have vectors of
  bit, int, double and other custom made data-types. VHDL strong type systems
  enables a designer to catch some bugs earlier in development process.
  \footnote{See the types available in VHDL language.  VHDL type system is
  stronger than Verilog. Why should it matter?}.

  Till now, we have the following information about the system :

%  \begin{table}[h!] 
    \begin{tabular}{r c l} 
      Port & Direction & Type \\
      \hline a & in & bit \\ 
      b & in & bit \\ 
      clk & in & bit \\ 
      reset & in & bit \\
      out & out & bit \\ 
    \hline 
  \end{tabular} 
% \end{table}


\section{Entity and Architecture pair}
  
In VHDL, any digital block is described by \textbf{entity-architecture} pair.
\textbf{Entity} describes what a system receives as input and what it generates
as output. \textbf{Architecture} describes how the system operates on input to
generate its outputs. If an analogy is allowed to be drawn with C/C++ languages,
it can be said that entity are like function declarations while architecture are
like function definitions. Let's see some code.

\lstinputlisting[language=vhdl, firstline=7 , caption=Entity declaration  ,
lastline=27]{../GHDLDemo/demo.vhd}

Now we should write the \textbf{architecture} for this entity. There are two
styles of writing architecture : \textbf{structural} and \textbf{behavioural}.
If we already know the components (as we do for this system) it is
straightforward to write the structural description. When we do not know the
components and their arrangements (usually the case!), we write behavioural
description. 

\begin{remark}[Structral vs behaviour]
 
  Structural architecture describes \emph{what is connected with what}. In our
  system we have three gates connected with each other and their output is
  reflected to \texttt{out} at each rising edge of clock (D-flip flop will
  ensure it.). Behavioural architecture describes \emph{what happens when}
  which can be described by the following equation.

  \begin{equation} out = \begin{cases} (a \land b) \lor \neg b & \quad \text{on
    rising edge of clock and reset is unset}\\ \text{no change} &
    \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \end{equation} \end{remark}

\paragraph{Structural architecture} Now let's see how to write the structural
architecture. We are using \texttt{COMPONENT} keyword in following listing.
Components are previously defined entities. This is similar to the idea of
instantiation of functions. 

We have not defined the entity-architecture pairs for components used in this
listing. We assume that they are readily available (\texttt{WORK} library).

  \lstinputlisting[language=vhdl , caption = We do not define the architecture
  of components used in this code.  Each component again has
  \textbf{entity-architecture} pair. We can write those in different files and
  compile that file separately using ghdl. How to do it is available in ghdl
  manual.  , firstline=27, lastline=74]{../GHDLDemo/demo.vhd}

  \paragraph{Behavioural architecture}

  This is a more natural way to describe the hardware. Most of the time we think
  in terms of behaviour of the circuit. 
 
  \lstinputlisting[language=vhdl , caption = Behavioural architecture ,
  firstline=75, lastline=200]{../GHDLDemo/demo.vhd}


  \begin{remark}{Handling multiple architectures of a single entity}
    
    We can have any number of architectures for one entity. If we do so, it is
    not clear which which architecture to use with the entity. Standard practice
    in VHDL is to write \textbf{configuration}. We don't discuss them here. If
    only one architecture is written, ghdl will figure it out by itself.
 
  \end{remark}

  \paragraph{Behavioural to hardware}
    
  Structural architecture is essentially a netlist of the circuit : which
  component is connected to which component. Therefore much is known about the
  circuit topology. But what about behavioural architecture? It is not always
  easy to convert a behavioural description to hardware despite the rising
  maturity of synthesis tools \footnote{Conversion of a description to a netlist
  of the hardware is called synthesis.} Fortunately for us, we are not concerned
  about synthesis in this course.  Anyway lets have a look at the hardware is
  generated by Xilinx tool.

  \begin{figure}[h] \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./../GHDLDemo/Xilinx/bhav.png}
    \caption{Hardware synthesised by Xilinx tool. Well, it looks like what we
    started with. We synthesised the behavioural architecture. When we write
    code for simulation, we can use full language. But all constructs of a
    language are not supported by synthesise tools and one has to rewrite that
    particular non-supported section of code.}
